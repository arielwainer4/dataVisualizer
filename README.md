# Covid-19 Visualizer

## Learning D3 in 4 Days

<img src="/assets/homepage.png">

Throughout the past 6 months, I've spent countless hours pouring over COVID-19 data. From line graphs representing positive cases in New York City, to animated maps demonstrating how hot spots have progressively migrated across the U.S, I have seen my fair share of informative and not so informative visuals with varying levels of complexity.

So when tasked with self-teaching a new tool for the Grace Hopper Stackathon, it felt like a natural first choice to see if I could learn to make a few Covid-19 graphs myself.

## About The Author:
This app was born as a bootcamp challenge to learn a new technology over the course of 4 days. My goal was to combine a practical skillset (D3) with information I found intriguing (Covid-19 tracking).
